          <p className="text-muted-foreground md:text-lg">
          As a Master of Computer Application (MCA) student at Marwadi University, with a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Application (BCA) and hands-on internship experience at CodSoft, I am eager to contribute my technical skills while gaining practical industry exposure.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground md:text-lg">
          During my CodSoft internship, I developed and deployed a responsive web application using React.js and Node.js, collaborating with developers through GitHub for version control. Additionally, my academic projects such as GreenStation (a sustainable product marketplace) and SkillHub (a student skill-sharing platform) showcase my abilities in full-stack development, REST API integration, database management (MongoDB/MySQL), and UI/UX optimization.
